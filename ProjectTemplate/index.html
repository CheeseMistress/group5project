                <h2>Changing the Face of Employee Engagement</h2>

                <p>
                    When people are asked to do surveys, the reaction ranges from indifference to disdain. Yearly surveys by
                    companies are often done in a rushed, careless way because employees just simply do not want to do them.
                    The data gathered from company surveys serve as a snapshot in time, and are potentially biased by the
                    mood and feeling of the employee on that particular day.
                    Flawed data leads to flawed decisions, which perpetuates an endless cycle leaving neither employer or
                    employee satisfied. Pascal is the answer to the timeless question of, “How do we make surveys less
                    terrible?”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Based on the adorable housecat by the same name, Pascal seeks to change the way that employers engage
                    with their employees. Rather than long and grueling surveys, employees chat with Pascal to create
                    confidential dialog that captures a deeper level of understanding of the feelings of employees.
                    Employers are able to create dialogs that focus on key questions regarding their companies and can use
                    that data to create meaningful change. After employees are done conversing with Pascal, they are able to
                    see the feedback that their peers have given and react to it giving employers a chance to see how
                    widespread complements or complaints are.
                </p>

                <div class="col-06">
                    <img src="" style="width: fit-content;"/>

                        Pascal is designed to converse with employees in short, frequent intervals allowing employees to mitigate
                        biases from recent events. To ensure engagement, employers can set rewards for participation. By
                        allowing employers to truly understand their employees, we believe that Pascal can make companies
                        better.
