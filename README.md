# Pascal- survey app 
This project is a fun and new way to get employees to share how they really feel about working for you!

## Description
We created this project to make surveys fun again. We were tired of the same old surveys that everyone uses. This app is an interactive fun way to gauge what your staff is really thinking. With Pascal you can create custom made surveys tailored to your employees. These surveys come in the form of an interactive conversation with our cute loveable cat, Pascal. By taking these surveys you will learn about your employees and employees can earn and manage rewards. 
As an admin you can view stored responses from employees in a customizable report. You can add or deny users from having access to the service. Once an account is established you can manage all your employeesâ€™ account information and make changes as needed. You can create custom questions for each survey that can be given to employees. Employees can take surveys when they have time, so they are not overwhelmed with workloads. Give it a try and see what you think. Our team is very proud of the work we have completed and would love to hear your thoughts.
