# Pascal- survey app 

This project is a fun and new way to get employees to share how they really feel about working for you!

## Description

We created this project to make surveys fun. Tired of the same old surveys that everyone uses, we created an interactive, fun way to gauge what your staff is really thinking. With Pascal you can create custom made surveys tailored to your employees. These surveys come in the form of an interactive conversation with our cute, loveable cat Pascal. By using these surveys, you will learn about your employees, and employees have the potential to earn rewards.  Employees can take surveys when they have time to avoid becoming overwhelmed with workloads.

Give it a try and see what you think. Our team is very proud of the work we have completed and would love to hear your thoughts.
