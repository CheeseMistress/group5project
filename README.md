Database person Lindsey is here, just testing adding a note.
I was able to connect to the database, set up an employer table, and add a fake company.
This is not a table of users (company user ids), just a table of the company data.
Can use the primary key (companyid) as a foreign key in the table of users to link them together.
Was also able to edit the c# to return the result of the test query (select * from employers).
If you run the the web services file, test connection and invoke, you will see the company I added to the table.
